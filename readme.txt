Fireplace is a virtual operating system for windows. It is created by MattieMonster (weird name I know).
Source code can be downloaded and can be edited using Visual Studio.

Commits will not always be nightly and I will try to make all commits work completely bug free!
(Even though they can't ALWAYS be bug free!)

Visual Basic and Visual Studio are all created by Microsoft, who happens to be the creator of CodePlex!

It uses the GPLv3.
